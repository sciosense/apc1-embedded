# ScioSense APC1 C Library
the C library for the Air Purification Combo ONE (APC1) sensor with UART or I2C interface from ScioSense.

The APC1 is a compact, box-shaped, all-in-one environmental sensor solution produced by
[ScioSense](http://www.sciosense.com) to precisely
measure particulate matter and aerosols, volatile organic compounds, temperature and
humidity. It leverages the ScioSense leading edge sensor technology to provide an
accurate, fully calibrated, maintenance-free solution to air quality monitoring.

For maximum flexibility, the APC1 provides up to 20 environmental signal parameters
through UART or I2C interfaces. Moreover, it features temperature compensation
algorithms to simplify integration on system level, thereby accelerating time to market at
minimal overall BOM costs.

The APC1 is a proven, maintenance-free technology, designed for high volumes and
reliability.
